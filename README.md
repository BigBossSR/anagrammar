#Anagrammar

######This is the Readme file for a web app called Anagrammar.
Anagrammar is not a guide to language usage written by a woman name Ana. Anagrammar is a piece of computer software to help you write anagrams.

###But wait, Scott. Can't I just use an online anagram generator?
Haha, yeah wouldn't that be nice!

###No, really, why not?
Oh you're serious. Online anagram generators can be a good starting point, but they really aren't effective for delivering usable anagrams. Instead they show you all possible combinations of the letters you input.
For example entering "Star Wars The Force Awakens" to wordsmith.org's anagram generator yields over 65,000 results. Page 1 only shows the first thousand, but they rely way more heavily on "canastas" than most anagrams I'm looking to construct.

###So what does Anagrammar do differently?
Anagrammar puts the power of anagramming back in your soft, human hands by letting you keep track of the letters you're using.
